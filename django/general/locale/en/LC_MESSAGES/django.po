msgstr "<h2>The Project</h2>"
"<p>Led by Dr Alice Corr at the University of Birmingham, The Grammars of "
"Judeo-Spanish is a documentation project which seeks to identify and map out "
"the grammatical landscape of Judeo-Spanish varieties as they are spoken and "
"written today. Whilst there are many reasons why such work is valuable, this "
"project is particularly concerned with the following benefits:</"
"p><ul><li><b>Fostering language survivance:</b> Because most Judeo-Spanish "
"research focuses on other aspects of the linguistic system we simply do not "
"know what the overall grammatical landscape of Judeo-Spanish looks like. "
"Without a detailed or accurate knowledge of what Judeo-Spanish's sentence-"
"level grammar is, the language cannot be taught or passed on to new learners "
"or future generations. Providing a description of grammatical description "
"can support community efforts to create and disseminate learning resources "
"and other language survivance activities important to those for whom Judeo-"
"Spanish is a component of their cultural and ancestral heritage and/or way "
"of life.</li><li><b>Language policy for historic and minoritized languages:</"
"b> Providing linguistically accurate data for Judeo-Spanish will promote "
"evidence-based policymaking, by providing the necessary data with which to "
"determine its linguistic classification and (re-)evaluate its official/"
"recognised status in line with national and international language policies."
"</li><p>The virtual linguistic atlas brings together a range of stories and "
"personal narratives from members of Judeo-Spanish speaking diaspora. It "
"collates existing recordings of Judeo-Spanish speakers with new, "
"crowdsourced recordings and texts, providing an interactive, contemporary "
"snapshot, and a major new dataset, of how current generations of Judeo-"
"Spanish speak and write in this important historical language.</p><p>Hosted "
"by the University of Birmingham, Grammars of Judeo-Spanish is generously "
"funded by a British Academy and Leverhulme Trust grant.</p>"
