"<h2>The Project</h2><p>The Linguistic Atlas of Judeo-Spanishes forms part of "
"The Grammars of Judeo-Spanish research project. Led by Dr Alice Corr at the "
"University of Birmingham, The Grammars of Judeo-Spanish is a documentation "
"project which seeks to identify and map out the grammatical landscape of "
"Judeo-Spanish varieties as they are spoken and written today. Whilst there "
"are many reasons why such work is valuable, this project is particularly "
"concerned with the following benefits:</p><ul><li><b>Fostering language "
"survivance:</b> Because most Judeo-Spanish research focuses on other aspects "
"of the linguistic system we simply do not know what the overall grammatical "
"landscape of Judeo-Spanish looks like. Without a detailed or accurate "
"knowledge of what Judeo-Spanish's sentence-level grammar is, the language "
"cannot be taught or passed on to new learners or future generations. "
"Providing a description of grammatical description can support community "
"efforts to create and disseminate learning resources and other language "
"survivance activities important to those for whom Judeo-Spanish is a "
"component of their cultural and ancestral heritage and/or way of life.</"
"li><li><b>Language policy for historic and minoritized languages:</b> "
"Providing linguistically accurate data for Judeo-Spanish will promote "
"evidence-based policymaking, by providing the necessary data with which to "
"determine its linguistic classification and (re-)evaluate its official/"
"recognised status in line with national and international language policies."
"</li></ul><p>The virtual linguistic atlas brings together a range of stories "
"and personal narratives from members of Judeo-Spanish speaking diaspora. It "
"collates existing recordings of Judeo-Spanish speakers with new, "
"crowdsourced recordings and texts, providing an interactive, contemporary "
"snapshot, and a major new dataset, of how current generations of Judeo-"
"Spanish speak and write in this important historical language. Collecting "
"and sharing stories via the Linguistic atlas is part of the wider project’s "
"aims to document the grammatical landscape of Judeo-Spanish, and to record, "
"share and celebrate the cultural heritage and diversity of the Judeo-Spanish "
"speaking diaspora.</p><p>Hosted by the University of Birmingham, Grammars of "
"Judeo-Spanish is generously funded by a British Academy and Leverhulme Trust "
"grant.</p>"
